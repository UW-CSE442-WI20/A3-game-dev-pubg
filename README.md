### About

Do you want to watch PUBG but with game dev companies fighting each other? Do you want to know about the player's top choice company and their best-selling games? Well, you've come to the right place. Choose your Battle Arena, hit the play button and watch the top 20 companies fight for players from 2003 to 2016. 

### Initiative

Coincidentally, some of our team members chose to work on a game sales visualization in A2. We felt the limitation of still images - it's very unintuive to showcase the growth process of sales data over the years. That was why we wished to create a dynamic view of game dev company's performance in this assignment. 

### Graphics and design choices

#### Year slider

Since we wished to create a dynamic view of the game sales data on a yearly basis, a year slider should be a good resemblance to a timeline. Our original data contained game sales statistics from 1980s to 2016. However, a lot of the data were missing in the early stages of the Internet. Therefore we picked the starting point as 2003 to ensure the quality of data.
